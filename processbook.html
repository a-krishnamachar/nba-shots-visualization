        <h3>Background and Motivation</h3>
        <p>Over the past decade, modern data and analytics has revolutionized how NBA teams strategize and play basketball.
          Every team now has their own analytics departments and every game, cameras track precisely the
          movement of the ball and players on the court. Teams have used this data to determine the shots
          with the highest expected value, leading to a dramatic rise in  three-point shots.
          Players now wear health sensors that monitor their fatigue during practice, helping teams know when it
          is best to give a star player rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Teams have always used statistics and data to inform their decision making, however, in the past their data was basic and
          limited to things like shots, assists and rebounds. Now both teams and fans alike have
          access to highly detailed data for every game. However, increasingly detailed tracking leads
           to the challenge of having to sort through and analyze an ever increasing amount of data.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Related Work</h3>
        <p>We took inspiration from a few websites + visualizations that we have seen in the "wild".
          Foremost among these were a) visuals similar to the below heatmap (this one taken from Statsbomb [1]).

        <h3>Project Objectives / Questions Answered</h3>
        <p>We started out with the question, "I wonder how accurate LeBron is from the right side
          of the court v. the left?"
        </p>
        <p>As our thinking evolved, we realized we wanted to create something that would
          effectively display a player's shot accuracy from different parts of the basketball court.
        </p>
        <p>Through this project, we intend to convey information about individual players’ shot accuracy
          from specific parts on the court.
          The goal of this project is to sift through NBA player data to find meaningful insights
          and present them in an intuitive, visually appealing implementation.

          We hope to also boost enthusiasm of the game for fans and non-fans alike, and increase a
          baseline knowledge of the sport amongst all viewers!
        </p>
        <h3>Data</h3>
        <p>
          We plan on getting our data from the NBA official website
          (https://www.nba.com/stats/) which contains detailed statistics from every NBA game
           played dating back over twenty years. By using data supplied by the league itself,
           we can trust that the information is accurate and trustworthy.
        </p>
        <p>We expect to do some data cleanup as we will likely encounter more data than we
          actually need for the scope of this project, however, we expect the data itself to be
          easy to work with and won’t require much post processing. This is because the data we are
          interested in are mostly statistics from NBA games which have been checked many times prior
           to viewing them which makes any mistakes extremely unlikely.
        </p>

        <p>
          We used a python package called nba_api
      (https://pypi.org/project/nba-api/) to help us access the appropriate data for this project.
      This is an API client for www.nba.com that makes the API endpoints on the websites easier to
      access and helped make the process of data gathering more efficient.
      Once we had understood the scale of the data to the full extent,
        we then moved to integrating the call to the API directly into our javascript code.
      </p>

        <h3>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>

        <p>We initally utilized the python dataframe tool to inspect and understand our data.
          This was the quickest and most efficient way to rapidly iterate through the thousands of
          data points that we needed to analyze (hundreds of individual player shots; that then needed to
          be aggregated into one holistic value for the chart displays).
        </p>
        <p>
          The main goal of this visualization was to portray a specific player’s shooting percentage in different court locations.
          We also included league average (%s) of shots taken from those court locations.
          We will necessarily need to include those data points across an entire season for any
          player with, for example, more than 20 games played (20 arbitrarily chosen, number might change).
        </p>

        <p>Above, you can see how our design process initially looked. We used the Five Sheet Design Methodology
          to instruct and inform our process.
        </p>

        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>The main display is a base image of half of a basketball court (see above images). This serves as the background
          for the main visualization. The intent of this visualization is for a user to be able to quickly determine how accurate
          player X is from a specific section of the basketball court.
          <br>
          Users hovering over different portions of court will display shot
            accuracy on popup (tooltip). <br>
            (Secondary display) - A separate bar chart populates showing the selected player’s shot % compared to the
            league average for each part of the court.
        </p>
        <p>Users are able to "kickstart" the visualization by
          searching for players by name at the top of the page. The intent here is for a user to
          identify a specific player and then rapidly get the relevant information about that player.
          <br>
          For example, a user could select Chris Paul. The visualization will populate his
          average scoring accuracy + information.
        </p>
